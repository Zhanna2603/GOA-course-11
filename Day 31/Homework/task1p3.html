     <h1><i>Our confectionery products:</i></h1>
    <p>The magic of confectionery art is born from love for its complex and interesting business. The reliable foundation of a successful family company is honesty and responsibility to customers, as well as fast delivery. <br>

        To prepare desserts, cakes and other confectionery products, we use only fresh and high-quality ingredients - the same ones we usually buy for home: fresh nuts, juicy berries, aromatic fruits, heavy cream, delicate butter, crumbly airy flour, fragrant amber honey and much more. Everything you see in the catalog is made from natural ingredients and is available to order with delivery in Moscow. Emulsifiers, flavorings, palm oil and preservatives are strictly prohibited in our cake production. <br>
        
        <i>Our confectionery products are:</i>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>quality confirmed by a technologist and independent experts;</li>
            <li>loyalty to traditions and continuous development of recipes for cakes and other desserts;</li>
            <li>a wide range of fillings, including chocolate and natural fruits;</li>

        Each individual order for a pastry chef is a great opportunity to show off and fantasize. The most complex author's work remains "behind the scenes"! Only we know how this or that decor is created, how it is fixed on the cake, how much the cakes weigh and what helps several tiers hold their shape. The recipes for festive cakes, desserts, meringues and other confectionery products are carefully calculated by the technologist to achieve the ideal harmonious taste. <br></p>

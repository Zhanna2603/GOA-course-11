# We start iterating the indices of the list numbers_list in reverse order. 
# len(numbers_list) - returns the length of the list.
# We subtract 1 to get the index of the last element. The loop will continue up to index -1, not including it, since we are moving backwards through the list. Inside the loop, we check if the element with index i is even. 
# If the condition in the previous if is true, we return the even number found. We end the function and print the result. If there are no even numbers in the list, the function will end without returning a value.
